Questions that are worth it:

create a new pattern (card made, solution coded) [ZigZag Q1]

prevent pattern overlap usage for multiple pattern matches (card made)  [ZigZag Q2]

fix pattern scanning/validation issue (card made) [ZigZag Q3]

throw game file non-existent error (wikibooks isn't clear on how to do this, i need to innovate). This could make use of os module to determine if <puzzleName>.txt exists?

save puzzle mid-game (card made) [ZigZag Q6]

allow matching of rotated patterns (why in the hell would this be a thing???)

add pattern limits (card made, solution coded) [ZigZag Q4]

prevent symbolsleft decrementation upon invalid move [not sure, but no/low diff i think, just don't decrement symbolsleft if target cell is part of a pattern or a blocked cell]

validate row/column entries [not sure, but very much no diff, just check if <= grid size]

undo previous moves [ZigZag Q7]

prevent symbol placement at invalid locations [basically prevent symbolsleft decrementation upon invalid move no??]

wildcard (idk what implementation though, doublepoints or zeropoints or something else who knows)

Shuffle blocked cell locations (card made) [ZigZag Q8]


Final list:

zigzag q2-8, q14, q17, prevent symbol placement at invalid locations, throw game file non existent, validate row/column entries


Errors to fix:

1. invalid symbol placements [overwriting cells in a pattern, placing cells in the pattern section whre they shouldn't be, placing in blocked cells] (leading to symbolsleft decreasing without a change occurring to the puzzle)
2. Board scanning error (wrap-around error)
3. Row/column entry validation
4. File errors [invalid file name, cell in a pattern has no symbolsnotallowed list {puzzle1}, empty cell not in a pattern has a symbolsnotallowed list {puzzle4}]

These could come up in question 13, which has 4 parts to it.

Questions 11/12 are about 5 marks each, therefore low-diff/low-volume questions

Question 14 has about 13 marks available, therefore it will be a difficult/high-volume question.

Potential additional letters:

C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L(5),O,P,U,V(5),W,Y,Z


Extension Question I Like: 6 (adds convenience to game), 8 (makes game more interesting, similar to Q13 but looks easier imo), 9 (line bonus), 12 (diff scores for each pattern). One of these made use of Advanced Technique 4 (getting row/column from index position), but i cannot remember which one :(
